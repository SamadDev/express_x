## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Dependencies Used:
```yaml
flutter_inappwebview: ^6.1.5  # For webview
image_picker: ^1.0.7          # For selecting images
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2    # For local storage
provider                      # For state management
```

### Architecture:
- **Pattern**: Provider (ChangeNotifier)
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences (JSON)
- **State Management**: Reactive updates via notifyListeners()

### Data Model:
```dart
class BagItem {
  String id;              // Unique identifier
  String name;            // Product name
  String? imagePath;      // Path to image (optional)
  DateTime addedAt;       // Timestamp
  String storeName;       // Store name (Amazon, eBay, Zara)
}
```

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Persistent Storage
```dart
// Data saved to SharedPreferences
// Format: JSON array of bag items
// Survives app restarts
```

### 2. Image Handling
```dart
// Uses image_picker for gallery selection
// Stores file path (not base64)
// Handles missing images gracefully
```

### 3. State Management
```dart
// Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier
// Reactive UI updates
// Single source of truth
```

### 4. Form Validation
```dart
// Product name: required
// Photo: optional
// Clear error messages
```

```

### 2. Reusable Components:
- BagService can be used anywhere in app
